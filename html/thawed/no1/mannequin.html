Dear Joan,<br>
A friend of mine told me that I could improve my singing ability by giving her my couch.
My logic tells me "Yes, of course.", but in the back of my head I keep thinking "This is a 
nice couch though." I don't know. What do you think?

Dear Jim,<br><br>
That's a toughy. Someone once said the same thing to Sheena Easton and look what it
got HER! Years later she told me that the couch-for-talent transaction
was worthwhile, but her ability to cook rice had vanished completely. There's always a trade-off Jim.

Hey Dummy,<br>
Are eels deadly?

Dear Leona,<br><br>
Yes.

Hey Joan,<br><br>
I'm a plaster mannequin and am finding that years of southern exposure
from being in the same window display is causing my once sepia-colored finish
to fade to a sort of blotchy peach. Any hope of restoring my old color?
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Keith</font>
<br><br>
Dear Keith,<br><br>
No. Sorry to be blunt, but no. You can temporarily stave off more fading
with ordinary boot oil, but it causes dizziness and memory loss. Better
get used to the name Peachy.
