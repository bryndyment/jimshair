Ok so this is the "Specials" page. This is where we will post special 
events, holidays, vacations, special things, special outings, 
special anything. Basically anything that we deem of "special" 
quality or worth. So check this page regularly. I think it will prove 
to be the most interesting.<br>-JD

<b>Hernia Trouble</b>
<p>
Well not much is special this week. Except for one thing. MY 
HERNIA! It miraculously came and went in one day! We have 
unconfirmed reports that it was caused by bracing myself too much
while trying to fight my way home against the whipping 
wind. I will definitly be taking a leigubill from now on. (BTW 
that is Icelandic for cab.) I am not declaring myself in 
remition yet though. The doctors say you should give it at 
least a year. You know, just to be safe.

This is a little illustration I did of The Hernia. I posted 
it for your viewing pleasure. I thought it might be theraputic 
to try and deal with the pain by working out exactly what 
I was experiencing on paper. (I think they call it Art-therapy 
or something) A nice little drawing don't you think?

<b>Pumpkin Chiffon... My Favorite!</b>
<p>

Another thing that is sort of special is that Thanksgiving is just 
around the corner. We are planning a "Special" Thanksgiving issue. 
(Well at least I am. Kevin and I are in a disagreement on the correct 
dates for thanksgiving. But I think we all know when the pilgrims 
REALLY landed!)<p>

So here is a little recipe to try out courtesy of Robline 
my dear sister. It is called Pumpkin Chiffon Pie. Ummm... now 
doesn't that sound yummy? So here goes.

<font color="#f2337d">
<pre>
1 1/4 c canned pumpkin
1 c brown sugar
1/2 c rich milk (who knows what this is?)
3 egg yolk, beaten well
1/2 tsp ground ginger
1 1/2 tsp ground cinnamon
1 1/2 tsp ground allspice
1 1/4 tsp ground mace
1/2 tsp salt
1 tbsp gelatin soaked in 1/4 cold water
3 egg white 
3 tbsp sugar

Combine pumpkin, brown sugar, spices, salt, milk and beaten egg yolks
in top of a double boiler. Set over hot water and cook until thick. 
Soak gelatin in cold water for five minutes. Add to hot mixture and 
stir until thoroughly dissolved. Remove from burner. Cool.

Beat egg whites until stiff. Fold in sugar and beat until stiff 
peaks form. Fold into chilled pumpkin mixture. Pour into any 
desired baked pie shell. Chill. Garnish with whipped cream. 
Ginger snap crust goes very well.

Ginger Snap crust. (don't worry this is a quick one)

1 1/4 c finely crushed ginger snaps
3 tbsp sugar
1/4 c butter melted

Mix all ingredients thoroughly. Press into a 9 inch pie pan. 
Bake 5 minutes in a 350 degree oven.

<b>Weather Update</b>
<p>
The last "special" thing that I can think of that happened this week 
is that it snowed yesterday. Not just a little slushy rain like the stuff
we get in Vancouver but huge fluffy white flakes. It was coming 
down in droves! It is what I would call a blizzard. Here is what 
it looked like from outside my window at work. Looks pretty blizzardy, hey!? 
But like the rest of the weather here it was gone in about an 
hour and it was sunny and warm for the rest of the day. (Almost tropical!)

That concludes our "specials" of the week. We hope you check back next week
when we will feature photos from our Thanksgiving dinner and let you know 
how that pumpkin chiffon pie went over. If you want to write in your review
of the pie or just want to chat I can be reached at
