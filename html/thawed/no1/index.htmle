Welcome to Thawed. This is the first issue, and we're in the process of generating its content, but
that doesn't mean you're getting short-changed. To make up for the lack of supporting eye candy
this week, we're bringing in the ultra-fine images of the Corel Gallery ClipArt CD. Hey if one little 
portrait of Henry Winkler doesn't succintly summarize our recent visit to Europe's largest glacier,
 what does?<br><br>
Jacqueline has filed extensive reports on life here in Iceland, from the food of the week in our
"the little things" section, to her 24hr hernia in the "special" (*) section.
See what kind of advice our resident mannequin Joan is giving to those wayward souls out there in need
of guidance in "dummytalk". And if you need a little pep talk yourself, feel free to drop Joan a line.<br>
<br>
Most importantly, check back contiually as this sight will change a couple times a day...<br><br>Whoa.
