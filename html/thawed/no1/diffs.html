<b>Food of the week: Spunk</b>
<p>

It is the same thing that has been the food of the week since we landed. Opals, 
Gajols, Spunks, Topas... They are all the same. Small round disc type candies that 
(to sum it up) are like chewing on a soccer cleat. They have the flavour of salt 
and licorice. Hence the name saltlakrids. Not a good combination mind you. However, we 
still manage to go through about 2 boxes a day. I think they have some sort of 
addictive agent in them. There is really no other excuse for why so many people 
go out and carelessly squander their pay cheques on the darned things.<p>

Here is one of my favorite brands just for the lovely bird on the front of the 
box and the shape of the candies. Don't you think the bird is a little reminiscent 
of the Partridge Family? Ah the good old days. (These ones are the chewiest. 
You actually have to pick them OFF your teeth!)<p>

I have included the ingredients below for those of you who are conscientious 
about what you put in your bodies.
