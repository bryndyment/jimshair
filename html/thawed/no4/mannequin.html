dear dummy:
<br><br>
I keep getting gifts from my boss at work. It started off with a few small items 
like paperclips and staples that he had cleverly attatched to some memos for me
 to file. But last week, right out of the blue, he brought me a headset for my 
 telephone! He said romantically, "Now you can get more typing done while you're 
 on the phone!". How can I put the brakes on this madness?

Dear Ruzena,<br>
People like your boss have to be taught a lesson. Forget the calm chat, 
I'd move right to slashing his tires. I'd give you some sugar for his 
gastank, but mannequins don't have any use for sugar. I believe it is available 
at your local hardware store.<br>

hey dummy,
<br><br>
I'm really anxious to get in touch with my spiritual side. I don't know where to
 start. Can you recommend a good church?

Dear Taper,<br>
I've never really had to face issues of mortality. I was associated with a church 
for a brief period. Actually I was part of a nativity scene in front of the church
 (I was the Virgin Mary). It seemed like a benevolent outfit, it was called 
 "Safeway". Even the name gives you a nice feeling, and it's congregation was 
 always walking away with cart-loads of food! Check 'em out.<br>

Dear Joan,
<br><br>
Can you guess what I'm going as for Halloween? You! I'll be the hit of the party!
Any tips to make my get-up more convincing? 
<br><br>
love,<br>

Dear Kenji,<br>
Yeah, spend 7 years modelling last year's fashions in front of middle-aged tourists 
at a JCPenney in Mt. Vernon. Replace your own head half a dozen times because you've been 
improperly stored or some kid burned your face with a lighter. Spend thousands upon thousands 
of hours listening intently as Richard Dawson tells you about his ability to levitate.
 Spend 4 years soaking your hands in boot oil to get high, then spend another 3 
 trying to kick the addiction. You wanna be like me? Pay your dues!... Oh, and have fun!<br>
 Happy Halloween!<br>
Joan<br><br>
