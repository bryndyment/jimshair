Welcome to thawed 4. Hard to believe but Halloween's right 
around the corner. Once again we simply don't have 
a thing to wear. There's also that minor setback that 
Iceland doesn't celebrate Halloween. <br><br>
We're not letting any 
of that stop us though. Come Thursday we'll be loose on the
 streets of Reykjav&iacute;k, pounding on the doors of 
 unsuspecting Icelanders and demanding our candy.<br><br>
 The costume problem still remains. Jacqueline has put together 
 some suggestions for costume ideas in the "*" section for 
 those of you who were going to rely on the trusty old "French 
 maid" get-up again.<br><br>
 Joan's back from her trip abroad and has plenty of wisdom to 
 share, as well as some pretty nifty gifts, thanks for the
  flip-flops Joan!<br><br>
  Yes, we know there's a giant bee laying on the text and I'm 
  sorry you can't read this. I'm just trying to hold real still 
  while I type this in the hopes that it'll go away.<br><br>
  Happy Halloween! -j&k
