Once again Halloween is just around the corner and like everyone else we are 
totally unprepared.I don't know what Kevin is going to be. I have a couple
of ideas but I just can't make up my mind. It's a toss up between a princess 
or a genie.
<p>
In the specials this week we will take you on a little journey down memory
lane to have a look at a few old costumes. And for those of you thinking of being
a french maid again take a look at our <a href="#5">5 minute costume solution</a>.
<p>
Don't forget to cut out your <a href="#invite">invitation</a> to our halloween party! It promises to be a rager!

Remember this one. The good old standard clown costume. Everyone was a 
clown at least once. I know I was. Twice in fact. My mom says I was a real
natural. Thanks to Patrick for his cute little photo!

The costume I remember as the all time coolest was my sister robbi's.
She went as a pack of lifesavers and spent weeks putting together her
costume. She looked great but forget about pulling off any of those sizzling
euro dance moves.

<b>Plastic Man</b>
<br>
Here is one that I saw last year that I thought was ingenious.
Scary Plastic Man! All you need is a roll of saran wrap. 
<p>
<b>Directions</b>
<br>
Take one roll of saran wrap. Rap it around your body
until completely covered. Leave opening for mouth.
<p>
<b>Caution:</b>Stay away from open flames. 
<p>
The great thing about this one is that you can reuse it.
