I have been keeping a horrible secret for some time now. 
A select few such as, 
Jen, Patrick (my promotions manager) and Shayne, 
know the truth but I must let everyone know. Not only have 
I been decieving the school, my friends, my family but worst
of all, my psychic.
<p>

The truth is that I have been decieving everyone about my true
identity. And although I promised Jen I would never expose her 
I have to. I am sorry Jen. 
<p>

My true identity is "RETRIBUTION", and Jen was my partner "VENDETTA".
Together we were... The "Rock n'Roll Women of Wrestling".
I know many of you may find it hard to believe, especially you JoJo. 
What can I say I am ashamed for misleading you all.
<p>

Vendetta (Jen) and I had to break up the team earlier this year due to artistic 
differences. I was tired of tag team routine and was looking for a different
direction. Those of you in the wrestling circle you already know
that the finest wrestling academies are here in Iceland.
<p>

I have taken on a new identity since my arrival. My new name, 
Svi&etha&aeligta, pronounced sveetha-eeta, is Icelandic meaning 
<a href="diffs.html#sheep">"The Eater of Burnt Sheep Heads"</a>
(a tradition here in Reykjavik).
<p>
I started my training at the IISW, the International Institute of 
Sumo Wrestling, as soon as we arrived and have been going strong 
for 5 weeks. It is a new discipline for me and I am adapting my mexican 
moves quickly. I have also been on a very regimented diet of whale, 
eggs and tatertots.
<p>

This past weekend I participated in the nationals. 
I have to thank Kevin who came out and cheered me on. 
I managed to walk away with the silver in my weight division. 
Not bad for a beginner (so to speak). The next big tournament is 
at the end of November. There promises to be lots of great wrestling, 
and meat.
<p>

Again my apologies. 
<p>
Sincerely,<br>
Svi&etha&aeligta
