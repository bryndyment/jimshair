<b>Icelandic food of the Week: Svi&etha</b>
<p>
At last, Iceland's best kept culinary secret is unveiled, svi&etha (<i>swee-</i>tha).
A very tasty traditional dish usually enjoyed on special
occasions and often served at Christmas. Svi&etha has a pungent, smokey flavour 
associated with summertime barbeques, but a delicacy enjoyed any time 
of the year. Svi&etha would best be described as... well,

<b>Quirky little speech thing:"J&aacute;" </b>
<p>
<img src="images/yow.gif" align bottom>
Pronounced "yow" it means yeah. And just like in casual English conversation, it is 
used to acknowledge that you understand what someone's saying. Like "yeah, uh-huh, yep" etc.
There's one little difference though, it is very often pronounced on the inhale, making 
it sound much like the speaker is exasperated or excited. I first encountered it as I was
explaining something to one of the guys here at Gottfolk. As I spoke, he would casually
offer the "yow" as he drew breath. It sort of sounded like he was saying "how" in 
disbelief. Took me a while to get used to.

<b>Most Fashionable Item In Iceland</b>
<p>
The results from our fashion watch are in. We have been carefully 
studying the fashion scene and have noticed many sizzling euro styles. 
Most popular -and unexpected- accessory, however, is the pram. 
Yes that's right, baby carriages. We're not talking about those
little fold-up jobies either. It's the old-school 1930's type that 
look like a hearse.

We each went out and
bought one this weekend just to fit in. You can't walk down
the street without one and not have people looking at you oddly. The only 
problem is that we don't have anything to put it them. I was thinking
along the lines of a anatomically correct doll. Kevin was thinking more
along the lines of a roast. What do you think? Let us know at
