Hey Dummy,
<br><br>
I'm having difficulty discerning between good and evil lately. I look 
at the newspaper, the TV, even my church, and the issues are so confused 
anymore I just can't make up my mind. I see my wife or son and think "good", 
I see Carl Weathers, I think "good". Hitler "evil". Those ones are pretty 
clear. I see my couch and think "good" right? Evil? Jim Nabors? Evil? 
Drapes, evil. Shasta pop, evil. How about my iron? My neighbor's helmet? 
How am I supposed to feel about all these things?

Dear Derek,<br>
It's real simple, if something's evil it goes to hell right? 
And what happens once it's in hell? It burns doesn't it? Therefore, 
all evil things are flammable, and must be burned to the ground. 
Makes sense right? Good luck.<br>
Joan<br><br>

hey joan,
<br><br>
My boyfriend is a real insomniac. He gets up frequently during the 
night quite often in terror, insisting that we're in danger. Then, 
by the time I'm fully awake and dealing with the situation, he's 
comfortably back asleep and I lose half a night. Worst part is, 
he never remembers a moment of it, and refuses to believe me 
when I tell him about it. What should I do?

Dear Gerald,<br>
Hey if a tree falls and noone's around to hear it... Your word against 
his. How do you know <i>you're</i> not the one dreaming? For all you know, 
you don't even have a boyfriend! I'd be careful about imposing your version
 of reality on others.<br>

Dear Joan,

Who'd have thought, Holyfield in the 11th?

Dear Dennis,<br>
God knows I've been praying for it ever since Tyson hooked up 
with that criminal Don King!  <br>
 <br>HO-LY-FIELD! HO-LY-FIELD! HO-LY-FIELD!
