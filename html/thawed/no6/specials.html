This is it. The latest in Technology here, the Polaroid Land Camera. The process, invented by 
Mr. Land, was developed for his daughter. It all came about at her seventh birthday party. 
When her father was taking pictures she began to cry because she had to wait to see them.
Mr. Land, a chemist, then decided to develop a method that would allow you to take pictures 
and see them almost instantaneously. To find out how to use your new camera click on the arrow.
