My girlfriend loves animals. She's a very nurturing person and 
will come to the aid of any animal in need. When she found her 
current dog Puddles, he had psoriasis. She nursed him back to 
health an they've been inseperable since. That was several years 
back and Puddles is starting to show signs of age. I'm worried that 
when his number's up, she'll be devastated. How can I help in bracing 
her for Puddles' demise? Also, I wanted to make him into a robot 
when he dies, can I?
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>

Dear Zach,<br>
Sometimes the answer's right in front of you. You make this dog 
into a robot, and your girlfriend gets a pet that will outlive her.
Heck, Charles Nelson Riley did it.<br>

hey joan,
<br><br>
I've successfully converted several of my pets into robots. Lately 
the thrill of simply mechanising deceased animals has worn off. Last 
week I gave a dog a strobe light for a head. It seems fine, but my
 friends tell me I've gone too far. How so?

Dear Kenneth,<br>
Your friends are probably referring to an error that my friend
 Jack Lord made when he tried give a pet canary a 
 pencil-sharpener head; they always have to be near an electrical
  outlet.<br>

Dear Dummy,
<br><br>
I think my cat Kato may be a robot. How can I check?
<br><br>
love forever,<br>

Dear Jen,<br>
There's only one way of testing whether or not Kato is a robot.
 Coax her with a wadded up piece toilet paper that's been soaked 
 in luke-warm bathwater. This seemingly inert gesture is the only
way to awaken the deeply nested command in all robot pets that makes 
 them speak with a lisp thereafter. It's bizarre, but it's the only
  thing that works.
