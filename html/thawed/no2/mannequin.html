Hey Dummy,<br>
I'm being spied on. Everywhere I go, and everything I do seems to be scrutinized 
by a mysterious voyeur. I've been able to identify him as Bob Vila formerly of PBS's
 "This Old House". Am I in danger? 
<br><br>
Love always,<br>
Tesfu</font>
<br><br>
Dear Tesfu,<br><br>
We went through this before. Remember? That's not Bob Vila, it's your own shoulder. Take
 a slow, careful look. See? It's <i>just your shoulder.</i>

Hey Dummy,<br>
I drive a shuttle van for an airport parking company. It's a Ford Club Wagon with 
an extended roof. The side passenger entry door is a standard A5r unit activated by 
compressed air and was manufactured by a company called Lumitek Mfg. I've been having
difficulty with getting the door to respond when the switch is in the up (or "OPEN")
position. It's almost like a short or something. What's up?

Mahari,<br><br>
It can only be one of 2 things. I'm going to bet it's the 1st which is that if
your A5r was installed before 1992, it's a manufacturer's flaw and all pre-1992
A5r's were recalled in Dec. '93 by Lumitek. If that's not the case or if you own a later 
model, I would check the colfax coupling <i>beneath</i> the primary transfer housing.
It may need cleaning or replacing.

Hey Joan!<br><br>
Do you still give advice to celebs? If so, which ones?
<br><br>
Sincerely,<br>
Bati</font>
<br><br>
Dear Bati<br>
For the most part I gave that up when I relocated to Iceland. I do still keep in touch
 and give advice to a select few. Don't want to be guilty of name-dropping, but lets just say 
 that my most recent chat was with the daughter of the very same person who wrote Delta Dawn.

Hi Joan<br><br>
There's this guy at work who seems to like me a lot. But whenever we're alone
 together he starts joking around and being obnoxious. Is he hiding his feelings 
 or is he just a jerk?
<br><br>
Duh,<br>
Katrina</font>
<br><br>
Dear Katrina<br>
I think you might be confused about what I do. I'm only a mannequin. You're 
asking a dummy for advice about relationships. I can't imagine what kind
 of useful info you think I can provide! Weird.
