Welcome to thawed. This is the second issue. We have a new feature: a 
<a href="telnet://194.144.235.67">chat</a> program. Activate it
by clicking on "chat" at the bottom of these pages, and you'll 
instantly be chating with us real-time. We are usually 
here between noon and 3 pacific time but try us anytime. We 
always have a listener running.
<p>

We would also like to thank all the clipart celebrities for 
supporting us in our first issue. Their presence was so popular 
that we've decided to add a new page tentatively called 
"identify the celebrity from their clipart image". Watch for it
 next issue!
<p>

Thanks for all your mail. Joan thanks you too. And to the fellow from
 Singapore she suggests that before anymore attempts at levitation, 
 he should wax his shoulders <i>before</i> placing his father's medication
 beneath the tree -not after, that only causes swelling.
<p>
thanks.<br>
