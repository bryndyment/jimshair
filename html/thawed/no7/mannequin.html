Dearest Dummy,
<br><br>
You are receiving this letter from a bonafide relic. I am one of 
the few surviving mannequins designed by the late Fritz Napper and 
manufactured in Hollywood by Wellington's in 1933. Aside from a 
chipped left elbow, I am in mint condition. It would be nice to 
retire that way. I belong in a museum not a storefront. How do I get 
out of this racket?

Dear Cooper,<br>
This is an extremely rare treat! I thought those of you that survived 
the big shift to plaster in the 40's, had either been destroyed or 
were permanently hired on as part of Dick Clark's entourage! 
There are only 3 actual mannequin museums I'd recommend, but being 
a part of Dick Clark's entourage offers benefits like free Big Gulps
and nice felt hats. I can give you his number if you need it.<br>

Dear Joan,
<br><br>
What's the second-to-the-last line in the theme song to "All in
 the Family"?

Dear Dane,<br>
Ah yes, I had to get this one straight from Norman Lear! It goes: 
"Gee our old LaSalle ran great."

hey joan,
<br><br>
I'm a fairly new plaster-cast mannequin and am a little worried about 
a few of the rumors I've been hearing. Some of the older mannequins 
like to pull my leg, so I thought I'd check with you on a couple things. 
First off, can I really control the entire insect population with my mind? 
And secondly, did Redd Foxx really have a plot to rid the world of all 
vacuum cleaners?

Dear ssss#5c,<br>
Ah, how naive we are in youth! Yes, you do have <i>limited</i> control 
of the insect population. No, Redd Foxx had no such plot for the vacuum 
cleaners of the world. He toyed with eliminating starchy foods from his 
diet, and once sought the advice of his vacuum cleaner repairman. I 
suppose that's where that crazy rumor started.<br>
