One thing very unique thing about Iceland is its 
geothermal activity. I remember as a child hearing of 
some exotic island in the north where the sidewalks were 
naturally heated to melt the snow. Although this is only 
partly true for some of the main sidewalks downtown, all 
of the buildings here are naturally heated. That's right, 
no hot water tanks in the houses.
<p>
All of Reykjav&iacute;k is heated by the hot springs which 
lye underneath the city. It is a particularily active spot. 
The water comes out of the earth at about 100 C (212 F)
and must be cooled before being pumped into the houses. 
As it is, the water comes out of the tap scalding hot and 
smells strongly of minerals such as sulphur.
<p>
These sheds can be seen on almost every corner in a 2 or 3
block radius of Gottf&oacute;k. They act as a sort of thermostat 
to regulate the temperature and you can see them puffing 
out steam all day long.
